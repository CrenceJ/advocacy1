                    <p>The right of children with special needs to receive education was the initial issue to deploy the "Community Living Movement" back in the 1950s. Back then, it was broadly believed that children with special needs could not learn. Parents and guardians of these children who understands their potential to learn, answered by creating their own schools.
                    </p>


                    <p>In 1955, parents and guardians created a provincial organization, which eventually became the BC Association for Community Living, and currently, Inclusion BC. Ever since, families have advocated for changes in government laws and policies so that their children with special needs would have the same right to be educated as other children. Government then gradually accepted responsibility for funding these schools run by parents and eventually agreed that not just funding, but public schooling, should be available to children with special needs. Inclusive education eventually came in the late 1980s.

                    <p>Inclusive Education is an extensive topic among schools not only in the Philippines, but in the whole world. Having different and diverse students learning together in the same room is a wonderful thing. In these types of setting, students and staff participate side by side in achieving goals and destroying barriers among themselves. Inclusive systems among schools provide quality education for all students and influential in altering and annihilating discriminatory attitudes. The importance of Inclusive Education in schools is to provide a child's first relationship in the outside world to empower social participation and relationships.

                    <p>Saint Louis University has Institute for Inclusive Education established in February 2007 main of the Institute for Inclusive Education is that learners especially those with disabilities will be assured of equitable success in terms of education through inclusive practice. The Institution of Inclusive Education of the university make sure that learners who have disabilities will be given special accomodations so that they can keep up with the demand of the universities along with their other schoolmates. At the same this Institution they offer services and trainings to public and private schools around Baguio City. Teachers will train on how to treat right students with physical or mental disabilities.</p>

                    <p>Guidance Center of Saint Louis University is very much advocate with attending students with unique learning needs. Guidance Center came up with a program called Student’s with unique learning needs formerly called students’ with special needs so the purpose of this program is to accommodate not just those with students with physical disabilities also students who have psychological conditions. </p>

                    <p>Inclusive education it not a privilege but a right. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act states that all children with disabilities should be provided with education with non-disabled children with the same age group and should have access to the general education curriculum provided by the school.</p>
